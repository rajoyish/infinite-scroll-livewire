## About the project

Adding infinite scroll to Livewire can be tricky. Let’s implement a really easy (but slow) solution, and then look at a better way to continuously load more records as we scroll the page.

We’ll also include a really easy way to implement the Intersection Observer API with an Alpine plugin, and add some enhancements to create a nice, smooth scrolling experience.
